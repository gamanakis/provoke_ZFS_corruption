Preliminary results of the bisect are [below](#2025-04-08-bisect-conclusion). There has been discussion during the testing at <https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/discussions/17203> and per suggestion, I will be repeating the test on 30af21b02569ac192f52ce6e6511015f8a8d5729. I have also add some further verification to the results for the final "good" test.

    Implement Redacted Send/Receive
    
    Redacted send/receive allows users to send subsets of their data to
    a target system. One possible use case for this feature is to not
    transmit sensitive information to a data warehousing, test/dev, or
    analytics environment. Another is to save space by not replicating
    unimportant data within a given dataset, for example in backup tools
    like zrepl.
    
    Redacted send/receive is a three-stage process. First, a clone (or
    clones) is made of the snapshot to be sent to the target. In this
    clone (or clones), all unnecessary or unwanted data is removed or
    modified. This clone is then snapshotted to create the "redaction
    snapshot" (or snapshots). Second, the new zfs redact command is used
    to create a redaction bookmark. The redaction bookmark stores the
    list of blocks in a snapshot that were modified by the redaction
    snapshot(s). Finally, the redaction bookmark is passed as a parameter
    to zfs send. When sending to the snapshot that was redacted, the
    redaction bookmark is used to filter out blocks that contain sensitive
    or unwanted information, and those blocks are not included in the send
    stream.  When sending from the redaction bookmark, the blocks it
    contains are considered as candidate blocks in addition to those
    blocks in the destination snapshot that were modified since the
    creation_txg of the redaction bookmark.  This step is necessary to
    allow the target to rehydrate data in the case where some blocks are
    accidentally or unnecessarily modified in the redaction snapshot.
    
    The changes to bookmarks to enable fast space estimation involve
    adding deadlists to bookmarks. There is also logic to manage the
    life cycles of these deadlists.
    
    The new size estimation process operates in cases where previously
    an accurate estimate could not be provided. In those cases, a send
    is performed where no data blocks are read, reducing the runtime
    significantly and providing a byte-accurate size estimate.

* `[1]` Test ran for hours w/ wrong ownership and the stir process changed nothing. When file ownership was fixed, corruption was nearly instant.

## 2025-02-04 process improvements

These have worked, producing corruption in less than a day. This should shorten testing time and also proves that the H/W in use will produce corruption using current Debian kernel and ZFS. [More details](./tests/2025-02-03_methodology/results.md) In addition, the scripts have been tweaked to work on FreeBSD (with `bash`) and corruption was produced on a FreeBSD host.

## 2025-02-11 Test instructions

Configure a host and two pools `send` and `recv`. Review the scripts that will be used as my user name `hbarta` has been hard coded in too many places. (PRs to corract that gratefully accepted.)

0. Run the `populate_pool.sh` script as `root` to populate the send pool. It does not terminate when there is sufficient data and will need to be killed when the `send` pool reaches about 50% capacity. The easiest way to kill it is to find the PID of the script and `kill <PID>` as root.
1. Run `syncoid` as `root` manually once to mirror `send` to `recv`. Set permissions or ownership on the resulting files in `send` to allow user modification.
1. Execute `zfs allow` as `root` to provide appropriate permissions so that `syncoid` can run as your user.
1. Create a directory `~/logs` where the scripts will write logs.
1. Start the following three scripts. (I hard link them to the user `~/bin` directory for convenience but it is left to the user to make them available in the PATH.)

* `thrash_stir.sh` - This script will modify random files in the pool continuously and also capture recursive snapshots.
* `thrash_syncoid.sh` - This script will invoke `syncoid` continuously.
* `manage_snaps.sh` - This script will manage snapshots every minute to limit retained snapshots to 100 for each dataset.

All three scripts will check for and exit when corruption is detected. In addition I add a cron job as `root` to `zpool scrub` both pools several times/day.

For details on the exact commands used to prepare the test, please see [the methodology exploration](./tests/2025-02-05_methodology/setup.md).
